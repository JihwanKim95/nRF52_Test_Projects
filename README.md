# Testing firmware and suggesting new PoC with assorted hardware platforms
Repository for simple embedded software samples for nRF SoC, STM32F4, RaspberryPi and Jetson boards that tests one or two functionalities the hardware provides. 
Projects here will help document the software logic and use-case of each functionality, by simplifying and cutting down the logic to perform a single responsibility.
<br/> 
<br/>
These functionalities will be implemented in firmwares currently under research like BSPWon and Jellyfish.
