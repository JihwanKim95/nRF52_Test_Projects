# test embedded systems
Repository for simple embedded software samples for nRF52832 SoC, STM32F4, RaspberryPi, Jetson Nano that tests one or two functionalities the SoC and Softdevice provides. 
Projects here will help document the software logic and use-case of each functionality, by simplifying and cutting down the logic to perform a single responsibility.
<br/> 
<br/>
These functionalities will be implemented in firmwares currently under research like BSPWon and Jellyfish.
