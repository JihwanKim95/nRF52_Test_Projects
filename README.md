# nRF52_Test_Projects
Repository for simple embedded software samples for nRF52832 SoC that tests one or two functionalities the SoC and Softdevice provides. <br/>
Projects here will help document the software logic and use-case of each functionality, by simplifying and cutting down the logic to perform a single responsibility<br/> 
These functionalities will be implemented in firmwares currently under research like BSPWon and Jellyfish.
